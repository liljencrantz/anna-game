Performance:

* Use VBOs with primitive restart to render interpolated balls.
* Move ball interpolation into separate thread.
* Move rendering into separate thread, reserve main thread for AI, physics, etc.

World

* Loading and unloading of tiles for trees and other items
* Start supporting multiple ball and tree types
* Enable better ball and tree editing from Lua
* Collision objects, e.g. trees
* Multiple actor objects
* Clean up Lua bindings - drop the peers and use raw objects directly
* Reference counting for tree types, ball types, etc

Art

* Balls should use textures, not vertex colors
* Switch to using VBOs for
* Skybox
* Clouds
* Stars
* Finish the first tree type
* Make a couple more tree types
* Seasons
