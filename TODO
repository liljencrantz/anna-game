Performance

* Use fewer VBOs and primitive restart to render interpolated balls
* Move ball interpolation into separate thread
* Move rendering into separate thread, reserve main thread for AI, physics, etc


World

* Start supporting multiple tree types
* Enable better tree editing from Lua
* Collision objects, e.g. trees
* Clean up Lua bindings - drop the peer naming, make bindings mor complete
* Reference counting for tree types, ball types, etc
